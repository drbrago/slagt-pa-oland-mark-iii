# Editorial Review: Slagt på Öland Mark III

## Summary
Overall the project maintains a consistent tone of grim post‑apocalyptic survival mixed with absurd humor. The Swedish text mostly adheres to Year Zero Engine (YZE) principles. Some minor grammar and formatting issues appear, and a few rules would benefit from clearer wording. Below are notes per chapter with examples for improvement.

## README
- **Clarity**: Good overview with table of contents.
- **Suggestion**: line "Spelet bygger helt" could be simplified. *Example rewrite:* "Spelet bygger på **Year Zero Engine SRD v1.0** och presenterar..."

## Intro
### what-is-the-game.md
- Introduces premise well.
- Consider clarifying bullet list: "Kampen mot maskiner" → "Kampen mot DishCores maskiner".

### backstory.md
- Fun timeline but some sentences are long.
- *Example rewrite:* "DishCore inleder Projekt TotalRenhet – biologisk krigsföring och mördarmaskiner".

## Characters
### character-creation.md
- Step-by-step process is clear.
- Minor grammar: "Följ dessa steg för att skapa en överlevare" (remove "en" before "överlevare"?)

### archetypes.md
- Consistent tone. Ensure talent names match those in Talanger-chapter.

### talents-and-secrets.md
- Table uses vertical bars correctly but could benefit from full sentences in "Effekt" column.
- *Example rewrite:* "Monsterkok" → "Du kan laga muterat kött utan risk".

### character-sheet.md
- Template works; consider adding placeholders for Stress and Mutation.

## Rules
### yze-core.md
- Comprehensive explanation of YZE. Some sections repeat ("Hälsa & Sinnen" appears twice). Consolidate duplicate text.
- Ensure examples use same terminology: sometimes "Skifte" vs "Skift".

### 04_gear-and-skills.md
- Good details on equipment and repair.
- Typo: "utrutning" should be "utrustning" if present.

### 05_combat.md
- Clear combat steps. The initiative text mixes D6 draw and card initiative. Decide on one approach.
- *Example rewrite:* "När bråket bryter ut kastar varje deltagare en D6" → "När striden startar kastar varje deltagare en T6".

### skills-and-pushes.md
- Good explanation of pushing rolls and stress. Check table formatting so it renders correctly.

### survival-rules.md
- Straightforward. Maybe add example of dehydration healing.

### hazards.md, mounts.md, vehicles.md, chases.md, combat-mutation-stress.md, magic.md, specialties.md
- Mostly clear. Some tables (e.g. in hazards) might need alignment.
- In magic.md clarify WP abbreviation first time it appears.

## Setting
### world-overview.md, hex-map-description.md, factions.md, key-locations.md
- Flavorful but short. Could expand on each faction's goals and conflicts.
- *Example addition:* Under "KODFRI" add a sentence about their base of operations.

## Gimmick
### introduction.md, gimmick-rules.md, blueprints.md, crafting-tables.md, weapon-parts.md, random-inspiration.md
- Fun system for home‑built weapons. Ensure risk mechanics mirror YZE gear rules.
- Some tables lack punctuation. Consider consistent capitalization.

## GM Guide
### how-to-run.md, adventure-hooks.md, themes-and-mood.md
- Useful tips but brief. Could add bullet lists for pacing advice or sample NPC motivations.

## Adventures
### starter-adventure.md
- Intro adventure sets tone. Expand each scene with obstacles or rewards.

## Threats
### zombies.md, mutations.md, encounter-tables.md
- Monsters fit the setting. Encounter table could include mechanical effects (e.g. difficulty or loot).

## Recurring Strengths
- Consistent Swedish language and tone.
- Clear connection to YZE rules.
- Concise lists and examples keep text approachable.

## Recurring Weaknesses
- Some chapters are short and could be expanded.
- Occasional grammar or formatting errors (missing periods, inconsistent tables).
- A few rules repeat or contradict (initiative methods, health section).

## Expansion Suggestions
1. **Mutation Exposure Rules** – Introduce a system where prolonged contact with Silex or radiation forces periodic mutation rolls. Success grants a beneficial mutation; failure gives a harmful one and stress.
2. **Faction Influence System** – Track player reputation with Öland's factions. High standing grants favors or gear, while low standing triggers attacks or sabotage.
3. **Scavenging & Crafting Subsystem** – Provide detailed steps for searching ruins, harvesting components, and assembling Gimmicks or defensive structures, tying directly into existing weapon-parts tables.
